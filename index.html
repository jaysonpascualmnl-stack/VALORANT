    <p>As of early 2026, the Valorant roster features 28 Agents, categorized into four distinct roles. Each role defines the agent's primary responsibility on the team. Here is the complete list of characters: Duelists
Aggressive playmakers who create space for the team and engage in direct combat.
Jett Phoenix Reyna Raze Neon Yoru Iso Waylay (Released March 2025) Initiators
Experts at flushing out enemies and gathering information to start a site execute. Sova Skye Breach KAY/O Fade Gekko Tejo (Released January 2025) Controllers Strategic specialists who use smoke and barriers to slice up territory and control vision.
BrimstoneOmenViperAstraHarborClove (Released March 2024) SentinelsDefensive experts who lock down areas and watch the team's flank. SageCypher Killjoy Chamber Deadlock Vyse (Released August 2024) Veto (Released October 2025)
Quick Tip: If you're new to the game, Brimstone, Sage, and Phoenix are generally considered the most beginner-friendly agents to learn the basics of each role. Would you like me to give you a breakdown of the abilities for a specific agent?</p>





    <p>Valorant is a free-to-play 5v5 tactical first-person shooter (FPS) developed by Riot Games for PC, featuring character-based gameplay where players select "Agents" with unique abilities. The main game mode involves teams attacking or defending by planting or defusing a bomb called the "Spike". </p><br>



    <p>The Essentials
The Goal: Attackers try to plant a bomb (the Spike); Defenders try to stop them. First to 13 rounds wins.
The Combat: Gunplay is lethal and precise. One headshot usually equals one kill. The Twist: You play as Agents with unique abilities (smokes, heals, flashes, or drones) that help you control the map.
The Economy: You manage "Credits" to buy better guns and abilities as the match progresses. Why It’s Popular Roles: Whether you like being the aggressive "fragger" (Duelist) or the strategic "brains" (Controller), there’s a spot for you. Style: It features a vibrant, near-future aesthetic with a deep story involving a "Mirror Earth" conflict. Accessibility: It’s free-to-play and runs smoothly even on older PCs. Would you like me to suggest a "starter" Agent based on your favorite playstyle in other games?</p>
